Repository to archive some of my python scripts:

First script is quickscan.py, this script is a simple TCP port scanner with threading, ideal for quick testings.

Second one is archiveexplorer.py, This Python script helps you search for any file on your computer, starting from the root directory. Once it finds the file, it shows you the first 10 lines of its content. After each search, you can either look for another file or exit. The script keeps things simple, guiding you through the process with easy prompts and showing progress with a loading bar. Itâ€™s a convenient tool for quickly locating and previewing files.
